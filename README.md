# 👩🏻‍💻 Learn SQL

Hi, welcome to my SQL repo! 🙋🏻‍♀️

During my process of learning SQL, I have taken multiple courses and perused websites where I got to practice SQL questions. Then I thought, instead of practicing and forgetting about them the next day, why not compile my solutions in a repository where I can refer to and study. 

FYI, I have zero technical/programming background and have only began studying SQL in Jun 2021. 

I will be updating this regularly or as and when I can. 

Also, do take note that different courses/websites may use different SQL 'flavours' such as PostgreSQL (most common!), Microsoft SQL Server (more commonly known as "SQL Server" or "MS SQL Server" and, it's also my personal favourite), MySQL, SQLite and more.
