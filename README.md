# 👩🏻‍💻 Learn SQL

Hi, welcome to my SQL repo! 🙋🏻‍♀️

During my process of learning SQL, I have taken multiple courses and perused websites where I got to practice SQL questions. Then I thought, instead of practicing and forgetting about them the next day, why not compile my solutions in a repository where I can refer to and study. 

FYI, I have zero technical/programming background and have only began studying SQL in Jun 2021. 

I will be updating this regularly or as and when I can.
