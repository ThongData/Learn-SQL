# 👩🏻‍💻 Learn SQL

Hi, welcome to my SQL repo! 🙋🏻‍♀️

During my process of learning SQL, I've taken multiple courses and perused many websites with SQL resources whereby I got to learn and also, practice SQL questions. 

Then I thought, instead of practicing and forgetting about them the next day, why not compile my solutions in a repository where I can refer to and study, so this is why I created this repo! 

FYI, I have zero technical/programming background and have only began studying SQL in Jun 2021. 

I will be updating this regularly or as and when I can. 

Also, do take note that different courses/websites may use different SQL 'flavours' such as,
- PostgreSQL (most common!)
- Microsoft SQL Server (more commonly known as "SQL Server" or "MS SQL Server" and also my personal favourite)
- MySQL
- SQLite and more
