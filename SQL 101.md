## üìå Order of Execution

Sequence of how SQL runs the query:

1. FROM, JOINS - SQL fetches the data from the tables.
2. WHERE - Filters based on specified condition
3. GROUP BY - Aggregates / Groups data into groupings and remove duplicates.
4. HAVING - Filters grouped data based on specified condition.
5. SELECT - Selects the columns and expressions to display.
6. DISTINCT - Remove duplicates.
7. UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT - Can remove duplicates. UNION ALL include duplicates.
8. ORDER BY - Orders the columns.
9. OFFSET, LIMIT - Limits the results.

## üìå CRUD Operations

- **CREATE** - Create databases, tables or views
- **READ** - Read using SELECT clause
- **UPDATE** - Amend existing database records
- **DELETE** - Delete records

### Create Table

````sql
CREATE TABLE rooms (
  room_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, -- IDENTITY(1,1) refers to an identity key which auto-increments by 1
  room_no CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  bed_type VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  rate SMALLMONEY NOT NULL);
````

````sql
CRREATE TABLE students (
  ssn INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, -- Set as primary key and not null
  name VARCHAR(64),
  dob DATE,
  average_grade NUMERIC (3,2), -- Precision of 3 and scale of 2, eg. 100.00
  tuition_paid BOOLEAN);
````

### Update Records

Before running `UPDATE` clause, run a `SELECT` query to identify the exact row(s) to update to ensure that we update correct rows.

````sql
UPDATE guests
SET checkin_date = '2021-05-10'
WHERE reservation_id = 1001; - Specify condition to identify specific row(s) to update
````

````sql
UPDATE guests
SET checkin_date = '2021-05-10',
	checkout_date = '2021-05-15'
WHERE reservation_id = 1001;
````

````sql
UPDATE movies
SET title = "Toy Story 3", 
	director = "Lee Unkrich"
WHERE id = 11;
````

### Delete Records

Before running `DELETE` clause, run a `SELECT` query to identify the exact row(s) for deletion to ensure that we delete only the unwanted rows.

````sql
DELETE FROM guests
WHERE customer_id = 1005;
````

***

## üìå Relational Database

### Alter Table

````sql
-- ADD new column
ALTER TABLE guests
ADD last_name VARCHAR(15);
````

````sql
-- Add new column and set text default
ALTER TABLE movies
ADD COLUMN Language TEXT DEFAULT "English"; -- Set 'English' as default values in all rows of Language column
````

````sql
-- Alter column's data type
ALTER TABLE name
ALTER COLUMN firstname TYPE VARCHAR(128);
````

````sql
-- Alter column's data type
ALTER TABLE student
ALTER COLUMN average_grade -- eg. original output is 98.68
TYPE INTEGER -- Alters to integer output, eg. 98 (normally, will round down)
USING ROUND(average_grade); -- Round up integer instead to, eg. 99
````

````sql
-- Set / Drop NOT NULL constraint
ALTER TABLE students
ALTER COLUMN home_phone
SET NOT NULL; -- Set not-null constraint, OR
DROP NOT NULL; -- Drop not-null constraint
````

````sql
-- Drop column
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN old_column;
````

````sql
-- Rename column
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_column TO new_column;
````

### Remove Table

Use `TRUNCATE TABLE` to remove data from table with table structure still existing in the database.

````sql
TRUNCATE TABLE rooms;
````

Use `DROP TABLE` to delete the entire table including data from the database.

````sql
DROP TABLE rooms;
````

### Insert Records

````sql
- Using results from query to insert into table
INSERT INTO rooms (room_no, bed_type, rate)
SELECT
  col_1,
  col_2,
  col_3
FROM other_table
WHERE --conditions apply
````

````sql
INSERT INTO rooms (room_no, bed_type, rate)
	VALUES ('101', 'King', 120),
		('102', 'Queen', 100),
		('103', 'Deluxe', 80),
		('104', 'King', 120),
		('105', 'Queen', 100);
````

***

## üìå Table Constraints

Constraints give the data structure and help with consistency and data quality.

**Integrity Constraints**
1. Attribute constraints - Eg. data types on columns
2. Key constraints - **Primary keys**
3. Referential integrity constraints - Enforced through **foreign keys**

- Auto-increment
- Unique
- NOT NULL

````SQL
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD COLUMN id serial -- Add auto-incremental function to id column
````

### Primary Key

````sql
-- Set primary key using CONCAT
UPDATE cars
SET id = CONCAT(make, model); -- Update id with make + model

ALTER TABLE cars
ADD CONSTRAINT id_pk PRIMARY KEY(id); -- Make id a primary key
````

````sq;
-- Rename the organization column to id
ALTER TABLE organizations
RENAME organization TO id;

-- Make id a primary key
ALTER TABLE organizations
ADD CONSTRAINT organization_pk PRIMARY KEY (id);
````

````sql
ALTER TABLE guests
ADD CONSTRAINT first_name_unq UNIQUE (first_name); -- 'first_name-unq' represents name of the constraint
````

### Foreign Key

````sql
ALTER TABLE a
ADD CONSTRAINT a_fkey FOREIGN KEY (b_id) REFERENCES table_b (id)
````



**Reference a Table with FOREIGN KEY**

For example, you want the `professors` table to reference the `universities` table using `university_id`.

````sql
-- Rename column to xxx_id
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;

-- Add a foreign key on professors referencing universities
ALTER TABLE professors
ADD CONSTRAINT professors_fkey FOREIGN KEY (university_id) REFERENCES universities (id);
````

**How to Populate Foreign Key from Another Table**

````sql
UPDATE table_a
SET column_to_update = table_b.column_to_update_from
FROM table_b
WHERE condition1 
  AND condition2 
  AND ...;
````

For example,
````sql
UPDATE affiliations
SET professor_id = professors.id
FROM professors
WHERE affiliations.firstname = professors.firstname 
	AND affiliations.lastname = professors.lastname;
````

### NULL Values

Take note that we cannot use `!=` or `<>` on NULL values.

````sql
SELECT 
  WorkOrderID, 
  ScrappedQty, 
  ScrapReasonID
FROM Production.WorkOrder
WHERE ScrapReasonID IS NOT NULL;
````

**ISNULL**

For example, replace NULL values with '99'.
````sql
SELECT 
  WorkOrderID, 
  ScrappedQty, 
  ISNULL(ScrapReasonID, 99) AS ScrapReason
FROM Production.WorkOrder;
````

***

## üìå Index

Index improves the speed of looking through the table's data. Without an index, SQL performs a table scan by searching for every record in the table. 

It acts as 'Table of Content' in a book - it's (usually) much faster to look up something in a book by looking at its index than by flipping every page until we find what we want.

### Create Index

### Drop Index

***

## üìå Data Types

- text - character strings of any length
- varchar(x) - a maximum of 'x' characters
- char(x) - a fixed-length string of 'x' characters
- boolean - True(1) , False(0) or NULL
- date, time, timestamps - date, datetime, timezone
- numeric - float, decimal
- integer - whole numbers

### Use CAST to other data types 

````sql
SELECT 
	CAST(some_column AS integer)
FROM table;
````

````sql
SELECT 
  transaction_date, 
  (amount + CAST(fee AS integer)) AS net_amount 
FROM transactions;
````

***

## üìå Filtering Techniques

### Using WHERE

### Limit Results with TOP

**Limit results with TOP**
````sql
SELECT 
  TOP 3 TaxRate
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC;
````

**Limit results with TOP PERCENT**

Specify the number of percentage of results to generate. For example, to generate the first 50% of the results, use `TOP 50 PERCENT`. 

````sql
SELECT 
  TOP 50 PERCENT TaxRate, 
  Name
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC;
````

**Limit results with TOP X WITH TIES**

Results include multiple records of the same values from the last record. 

For example, we are interested to know the Top 5 students in the classroom. Since there are 2 students who have received the same 5th highest score in the classroom, hence there will be a total of 6 rows of records in the results table - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.

````sql
SELECT 
  TOP 5 WITH TIES student_name, 
  score
FROM classroom
ORDER BY score;
````

### Remove duplicates with DISTINCT

To remove duplicates and retrieve unique values only.

````sql
SELECT 
  DISTINCT City, 
  StateProvinceID
FROM Person.Address
ORDER BY City;
````
### Using ISNUMERIC()

To return values that are numeric only.

````sql
SELECT 
	ISNUMERIC(student_score)
FROM School.Scores;
````

### Comparison operators

| Comparison Operator | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| =                   | Equal to    |
| !=                  | Not equal to    |
| <>                  | Not equal to   |
| >                   | Greater than    |
| >=                  | Greater than or equal to    |
| <                   | Less than    |
| <=                  | Less than or equal to    |
| BETWEEN ... AND ... |     |
| NOT BETWEEN ... AND ... |     |
| IN (..., ..., ...)    |    |
| NOT IN (..., ..., ...)  | |

### Match texts using LIKE and Wildcards**

````sql
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%' -- Finds any values that starts with "a"
WHERE first_name LIKE '%a' -- Finds any values that ends with "a"
WHERE first_name LIKE '%ae%' -- Finds any values that have "ae" in the middle
WHERE first_name LIKE '_b%' -- Finds any values with "b" in the second position
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a_%_%' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%o' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a___' -- Finds any value that starts with "a" and has 3 characters
WHERE first_name LIKE '[abc]%' -- Finds any values with "a", "b" or "c"
WHERE first_name LIKE '[a-f]%' -- Finds any values with "a" to "f"
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a[l-n]' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and has "l", "m" or "n"
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a[c-e]__' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and has "c", "d" or "e" in the middle and ends with 2 characters
````

***

## üìå JOINS

- `INNER JOIN`: Only returns matching rows.
- `LEFT JOIN` (or `RIGHT JOIN`): All rows from main table + matches from joining table.
- `NULL`: Displayed if no match is found in `LEFT JOIN` / `RIGHT JOIN`.

### Inner Joins

````sql
SELECT 
  p.BusinessEntityID, 
  p.FirstName, 
  p.LastName, 
  pp.PhoneNumber
FROM Person.Person AS p
JOIN Person.PersonPhone AS pp
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = pp.BusinessEntityID;
````  

### Left Joins

````sql
SELECT 
  p.BusinessEntityID, 
  p.PersonType, 
  p.FirstName, 
  p.LastName, 
  e.JobTitle
FROM Person.Person AS p
LEFT JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID;
````

### Right Joins

````sql
SELECT 
  p.BusinessEntityID, 
  p.PersonType, 
  p.FirstName, 
  p.LastName, 
  e.JobTitle
FROM Person.Person AS p
RIGHT JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID;
````

### Cross Joins

For example, table_1 has 10 rows and table_2 has 5 rows. A `CROSS JOIN` would result in 10 rows x 5 rows = 50 rows table.

````sql
SELECT 
  d.Name AS DepartmentName, 
  a.Name AS AddressName
FROM HumanResources.Department AS d
CROSS JOIN Person.AddressType AS a;
````

### Combine results with UNION

`UNION` excludes duplicate rows in both set of queries whereas, `UNION ALL` includes any duplicate rows in the sets of queries.

To use `UNION` or `UNION ALL`, when combining data from different tables
- Select same number of columns in same order
- Columns should have same data type

````sql
SELECT ProductCategoryID, NULL AS ProductSubCategoryID, Name
-- Create an empty column to represent ProductSubCategoryID column from 2nd table. Both table data types must be same.
FROM Production.ProductCategory
UNION
SELECT ProductCategoryID, ProductSubCategoryID, Name
FROM Production.ProductSubcategory;
````

### Return distinct rows with EXCEPT

````sql
SELECT BusinessEntityID
FROM Person.Person
WHERE PersonType <> 'EM' -- Select everyone who is not an employee
EXCEPT
SELECT BusinessEntityID
FROM Sales.PersonCreditCard; -- Everyone with credit card
````

You can achieve the same results as above using a `LEFT JOIN` below.

````sql
SELECT p.BusinessEntityID
FROM Person.Person AS p
LEFT JOIN Sales.PersonCreditCard AS c --Same results using LEFT JOIN
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = c.BusinessEntityID
WHERE p.PersonType <> 'EM' AND c.CreditCardID IS NULL;
````

### Return common rows with INTERSECT

````sql
SELECT ProductID
FROM Production.ProductProductPhoto
INTERSECT
SELECT ProductID
FROM Production.ProductReview;
````

You can achieve the same results as above using `JOIN` below.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT(p.ProductID) -- Same results using JOIN
FROM Production.ProductProductPhoto AS p
JOIN Production.ProductReview AS r
	ON p.ProductID = r.ProductID;
````

***

## üìå Grouping records

### GROUP BY and COUNT

Every column in `GROUP BY` clause needs to be in `SELECT` clause.

````sql
SELECT 
  City, 
  StateProvinceID, 
  COUNT(*) AS AddressCount
FROM Person.Address
GROUP BY City, StateProvinceID
ORDER BY AddressCount DESC;
````

### GROUP BY and HAVING

`HAVING` must be used in conjuction with `GROUP BY`.

````sql
SELECT 
  City, 
  StateProvinceID, 
  COUNT(*) AS AddressCount
FROM Person.Address
GROUP BY City, StateProvinceID
HAVING City = 'New York'
````

***

  PIVOT (AVG(ListPrice) FOR ProductLine IN (M, R, S, T)) AS PivotTable; -- For every product line M, R, S, T we are going to find the average price
````

***

## üìå Create and Use Variables

Use Variables to avoid repetition of creating different queries using same variable. 

For example, having to create different queries to find for specific artists. Instead, we assign/declare placeholder `=@my_artist`. All we need to do is update the variable each time we run the query.

Syntax example:
````sql
-- To declare a variable
DECLARE @col_1 INT
DECLARE @my_name VARCHAR(100)

-- To assign value to variable
SET @col_1 = 5
SET @my_name = 'Katie'
````

### Using DECLARE

````sql
DECLARE @MyFirstVariable INT;

SET @MyFirstVariable = 10;

SELECT @MyFirstVariable AS MyValue, 
	@MyFirstVariable * 5 AS Multiplication,
	@MyFirstVariable + 10 AS Addition


DECLARE @VarColor VARCHAR(20) = 'Blue';

SELECT ProductID, Name, ProductNumber, Color, ListPrice
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color = @VarColor;
````

### Create counter for Looping Statement
````sql
DECLARE @Counter INT = 1;

WHILE @Counter <= 3
BEGIN
	SELECT @Counter AS CurrentValue
	SET @Counter = @Counter + 1
END;
````

````sql
DECLARE @Counter INT = 1;
DECLARE @Product INT = 710;

WHILE @Counter <= 3
BEGIN
	SELECT ProductID, Name, ProductNumber, Color, ListPrice
	FROM Production.Product
	WHERE ProductID = @Product
	SET @Counter = @Counter + 1
	SET @Product = @Product + 10
END;
````
