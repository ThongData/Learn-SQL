# ðŸš¨ Claims Of Innocence

Edit the query to find how many inmates provided last statements.

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(last_statement) 
FROM executions
````

This query counts the number of Harris and Bexar county executions. Replace SUMs with COUNTs and edit the CASE WHEN blocks so the query still works.

````sql
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN county='Harris' THEN 1
        ELSE 0 END),
    SUM(CASE WHEN county='Bexar' THEN 1
        ELSE 0 END)
FROM executions
````

Find how many inmates were over the age of 50 at execution time.

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM executions
WHERE ex_age > 50
````

Find the number of inmates who have declined to give a last statement.
For bonus points, try to do it in 3 ways:
1) With a WHERE block,

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) 
FROM executions 
WHERE last_statement IS NULL
````

2) With a COUNT and CASE WHEN block,

````sql
SELECT
  COUNT(
    CASE WHEN last_statement IS NULL THEN 1
	  ELSE NULL END) AS declined_statement
FROM executions
````

3) With two COUNT functions.

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(last_statement) AS declined_statement
FROM executions
````

Let's talk about the performance of the 3 versions. 
> In 1st version, SQL filters the table for rows in column last_stament with `NULL` values resulting in a smaller table, so it is less costly. Whereas in the 2nd and 3rd version, SQL has to look for the entire table where it had to `COUNT` **twice** in the 3rd version. The performance in 1st version is best and worse in 3rd version. 

Find the minimum, maximum and average age of inmates at the time of execution.

````sql
SELECT 
  MIN(ex_age), 
  MAX(ex_age), 
  AVG(ex_age) 
FROM executions
````

Find the average length (based on character count) of last statements in the dataset.

````sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(LENGTH(last_statement)),0) AS average_statement_length
FROM executions
````

List all the counties in the dataset without duplication.

````sql
SELECT 
  DISTINCT county -- not an aggregate function
FROM executions
````

Find the proportion of inmates with claims of innocence in their last statements.

````sql
SELECT 
  100 * COUNT (
    CASE WHEN last_statement LIKE '%innocent%' THEN 1
    WHEN last_statement LIKE '%not guilty%' THEN 1 -- not in the original answer script
 	  ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(*) AS innocent_statement_percentage
FROM executions
````
