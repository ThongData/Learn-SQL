# ðŸš¨ The Long Tail

> Long tails refer to small numbers of samples which occur a large number of times. When we plot these out, they form a small sliver far to the right of the center of mass which looks like a tail. Long tails indicate the presence of outliers whose unusual behaviors may be of interest to us.

> In context of Texas executions, the long tail refers to a small number of counties which have been known to conduct a large number of executions.

## GROUP BY Block

This query pulls the execution counts per county.

````sql
SELECT
	county,
	COUNT(*) AS county_executions
FROM executions
GROUP BY county
````

Modify this query so there are up to two columns per county â€” one counting executions with a last statement and another without.

````sql
SELECT
	county,
	last_statement IS NOT NULL AS has_last_statement,
	COUNT(*)
FROM executions
GROUP BY county, has_last_statement
````

## HAVING Block

Count the number of inmates aged 50 or older that were executed in each county.

````sql
SELECT 
	county, 
	COUNT(*) AS execution_count
FROM executions
WHERE ex_age >= 50
GROUP BY county
````

List the counties in which more than 2 inmates aged 50 or older have been executed.

````sql
SELECT 
	county, 
	COUNT(*) AS execution_count
FROM executions
WHERE ex_age >= 50
GROUP BY county
HAVING execution_count > 2
````

List all the distinct counties in the dataset.

````sql
SELECT 
	county
FROM executions
GROUP BY county -- Use GROUP BY instead of DISTINCT function
````

## NESTED Queries

Find the first and last name of the inmate with the longest last statement (by character count).

````sql
SELECT 
	first_name, 
	last_name
FROM executions
WHERE LENGTH(last_statement) =
	(SELECT MAX(length(last_statement)) -- Find for the longest last statement by character count
	FROM executions)
````

Insert the <count-of-all-rows> query to find the percentage of executions from each county.
	
````sql
SELECT
	county,
	100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*)
                    	FROM executions) 
	AS percentage
FROM executions
GROUP BY county
ORDER BY percentage DESC
````
