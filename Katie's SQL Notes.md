## üìå Table Design

### Create Table
````sql
CREATE TABLE rooms (
	room_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, -- room_id is auto-incremental value
	room_no CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
	bed_type VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
	rate SMALLMONEY NOT NULL);
````

### Insert Records
````sql
INSERT INTO rooms (room_no, bed_type, rate)
	VALUES ('101', 'King', 120),
		('102, 'Queen', 100),
		('103, 'Deluxe', 80),
		('104, 'King', 120),
		('105, 'Queen', 100);
````

### Delete Records

Before running `DELETE` clause, run a query to identify the exact row(s) for deletion to ensure that we delete only the unwanted rows.

````sql
DELETE FROM guests
WHERE customer_id = 1005;
````
### Update Records

Before running `UPDATE` clause, run a query to identify the exact row(s) to update to ensure that we update correct rows.

````sql
UPDATE guests
SET checkin_date = '2021-05-10'
WHERE reservation_id = 1001;
````

````sql
UPDATE guests
SET checkin_date = '2021-05-10',
	checkout_date = '2021-05-15'
WHERE reservation_id = 1001;
````

### Remove Table

Use `TRUNCATE TABLE` to remove all data from the table, however the table still exists in the database.

````sql
TRUNCATE TABLE rooms;
````

Use `DROP TABLE` to delete the entire table from the database.

````sql
DROP TABLE rooms;
````

***

## üìå Index

Index improves the speed of looking through the table's data. Without an index, SQL performs a table scan by searching for every record in the table. 

It acts as 'Table of Content' in a book - it's (usually) much faster to look up something in a book by looking at its index than by flipping every page until we find what we want.

### Create Index

**Create Primary Key**

````sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_guests_guest_id -- Name of your index
ON guests (guest_id); -- table name and column name
````

**Create Foreign Key**

````sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_guests_last_name -- Name of your index
ON guests (last_name); -- table name and column name
````

### Drop Index

## üìå Filtering Techniques

### Using WHERE

### Limit Results with TOP

**Limit results with TOP**
````sql
SELECT TOP 3 TaxRate
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC;
````

**Limit results with TOP PERCENT**

Specify the number of percentage of results to generate. For example, to generate the first 50% of the results, use `TOP 50 PERCENT`. 

````sql
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT TaxRate, Name
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC;
````

**Limit results with TOP X WITH TIES**

Results include multiple records of the same values from the last record. 

For example, we are interested to know the Top 5 students in the classroom. Since there are 2 students who have received the same 5th highest score in the classroom, hence there will be a total of 6 rows of records in the results table - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.

````sql
SELECT TOP 5 WITH TIES student_name, score
FROM classroom
ORDER BY score;
````

### Remove duplicates with DISTINCT

To remove duplicates and retrieve unique values only.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT City, StateProvinceID
FROM Person.Address
ORDER BY City;
````

### Comparison operators

| Comparison Operator | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| =                   | Equal to    |
| !=                  | Not equal to    |
| <>                  | Not equal to   |
| >                   | Greater than    |
| >=                  | Greater than or equal to    |
| <                   | Less than    |
| <=                  | Less than or equal to    |
| BETWEEN ... AND ... |     |
| NOT BETWEEN ... AND ... |     |
| IN (..., ..., ...)    |    |
| NOT IN (..., ..., ...)  | |

### NULL Values

Take note that we cannot use `!=` or `<>` on NULL values.

````sql
SELECT WorkOrderID, ScrappedQty, ScrapReasonID
FROM Production.WorkOrder
WHERE ScrapReasonID IS NOT NULL;
````

**ISNULL**

For example, replace NULL values with '99'.
````sql
SELECT WorkOrderID, ScrappedQty, ISNULL(ScrapReasonID, 99) AS ScrapReason
FROM Production.WorkOrder;
````

### Match texts using LIKE and Wildcards**

````sql
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%' -- Finds any values that starts with "a"
WHERE first_name LIKE '%a' -- Finds any values that ends with "a"
WHERE first_name LIKE '%ae%' -- Finds any values that have "ae" in the middle
WHERE first_name LIKE '_b%' -- Finds any values with "b" in the second position
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a_%_%' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%o' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a___' -- Finds any value that starts with "a" and has 3 characters
WHERE first_name LIKE '[abc]%' -- Finds any values with "a", "b" or "c"
WHERE first_name LIKE '[a-f]%' -- Finds any values with "a" to "f"
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a[l-n]' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and has "l", "m" or "n"
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a[c-e]__' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and has "c", "d" or "e" in the middle and ends with 2 characters
````

***

## üìå JOINS

### Inner Joins

````sql
SELECT p.BusinessEntityID, p.FirstName, p.LastName, pp.PhoneNumber
FROM Person.Person AS p
JOIN Person.PersonPhone AS pp
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = pp.BusinessEntityID;
````  

### Left Joins

````sql
SELECT p.BusinessEntityID, p.PersonType, p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle
FROM Person.Person AS p
LEFT JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID;
````

### Right Joins

````sql
SELECT p.BusinessEntityID, p.PersonType, p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle
FROM Person.Person AS p
RIGHT JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID;
````

### Cross Joins

For example, table_1 has 10 rows and table_2 has 5 rows. A `CROSS JOIN` would result in 10 rows x 5 rows = 50 rows table.

````sql
SELECT d.Name AS DepartmentName, a.Name AS AddressName
FROM HumanResources.Department AS d
CROSS JOIN Person.AddressType AS a;
````

***

## üìå Grouping records

### GROUP BY and COUNT

Every column in `GROUP BY` clause needs to be in `SELECT` clause.

````sql
SELECT City, StateProvinceID, COUNT(*) AS AddressCount
FROM Person.Address
GROUP BY City, StateProvinceID
ORDER BY AddressCount DESC;
````

### GROUP BY and HAVING

`HAVING` must be used in conjuction with `GROUP BY`.

````sql
SELECT City, StateProvinceID, COUNT(*) AS AddressCount
FROM Person.Address
GROUP BY City, StateProvinceID
HAVING City = 'New York'
````

***

***

## üìå Window functions

***

## üìå Condition statement

### IIF 

````sql
SELECT IIF (SalesYTD > 2000000, 'Met sales goal', 'Has not met goal') AS Status,
	COUNT(*)
FROM Sales.SalesPerson
GROUP BY IIF (SalesYTD > 2000000, 'Met sales goal', 'Has not met goal');
````

### If Else

### CASE WHEN

***

## üìå Create Temp Table

***
## üìå Subquery

### Subquery in SELECT
````sql
SELECT BusinessEntityID, SalesYTD, 
	(SELECT MAX(SalesYTD) 
	FROM Sales.SalesPerson) AS HighestSalesYTD,
	(SELECT MAX(SalesYTD) 
	FROM Sales.SalesPerson) - SalesYTD AS SalesGap
FROM Sales.SalesPerson
ORDER BY SalesYTD DESC
````

### Subquery in HAVING
````sql
SELECT SalesOrderID, SUM(LineTotal) AS OrderTotal
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
GROUP BY SalesOrderID
HAVING SUM(LineTotal) > 
	(
	SELECT AVG(ResultTable.MyValues) AS AvgValue -- subsquery no. 2. Cannot combine both subqueries as cannot do AVG(SUM(LineTotal))
	FROM
		(SELECT SUM(LineTotal) AS MyValues --subquery no. 1
		FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
		GROUP BY SalesOrderID) AS ResultTable
	);
````

### Correlated Subquery

````sql
SELECT BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName,
	(SELECT JobTitle
	FROM HumanResources.Employee
	WHERE BusinessEntityID = MyPeople.BusinessEntityID) AS JobTitle --Better to use LEFT JOIN as give same results
FROM Person.Person AS MyPeople
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT JobTitle
		FROM HumanResources.Employee
		WHERE BusinessEntityID = MyPeople.BusinessEntityID); -- Better to use JOIN or WHERE EXISTS

````

***

## üìå PIVOT

````sql
SELECT 'AverageListPrice' AS 'ProductLine', -- To add meaning to the table
FROM
	(SELECT ProductLine, ListPrice
	FROM Production.Product) AS SourceData
PIVOT (AVG(ListPrice) FOR ProductLine IN (M, R, S, T)) AS PivotTable; -- For every product line M, R, S, T we are going to find the average price
````

***

## üìå Create and Use Variables

### Using DECLARE

````sql
DECLARE @MyFirstVariable INT;

SET @MyFirstVariable = 10;

SELECT @MyFirstVariable AS MyValue, 
	@MyFirstVariable * 5 AS Multiplication,
	@MyFirstVariable + 10 AS Addition


DECLARE @VarColor VARCHAR(20) = 'Blue';

SELECT ProductID, Name, ProductNumber, Color, ListPrice
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color = @VarColor;
````

### Create counter for Looping Statement
````sql
DECLARE @Counter INT = 1;

WHILE @Counter <= 3
BEGIN
	SELECT @Counter AS CurrentValue
	SET @Counter = @Counter + 1
END;
````

````sql
DECLARE @Counter INT = 1;
DECLARE @Product INT = 710;

WHILE @Counter <= 3
BEGIN
	SELECT ProductID, Name, ProductNumber, Color, ListPrice
	FROM Production.Product
	WHERE ProductID = @Product
	SET @Counter = @Counter + 1
	SET @Product = @Product + 10
END;
````
***

## üìå Result set operators

### Combine results with UNION

````sql
SELECT ProductCategoryID, NULL AS ProductSubCategoryID, Name -- Create an empty column to represent ProductSubCategoryID column from 2nd table. Both table data types must be same.
FROM Production.ProductCategory
UNION
SELECT ProductCategoryID, ProductSubCategoryID, Name
FROM Production.ProductSubcategory;
````

### Return distinct rows with EXCEPT

````sql
SELECT BusinessEntityID
FROM Person.Person
WHERE PersonType <> 'EM' -- Select everyone who is not an employee
EXCEPT
SELECT BusinessEntityID
FROM Sales.PersonCreditCard; -- Everyone with credit card
````

You can achieve the same results as above using a `LEFT JOIN` below.

````sql
SELECT p.BusinessEntityID
FROM Person.Person AS p
LEFT JOIN Sales.PersonCreditCard AS c --Same results using LEFT JOIN
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = c.BusinessEntityID
WHERE p.PersonType <> 'EM' AND c.CreditCardID IS NULL;
````

### Return common rows with INTERSECT

````sql
SELECT ProductID
FROM Production.ProductProductPhoto
INTERSECT
SELECT ProductID
FROM Production.ProductReview;
````

You can achieve the same results as above using `JOIN` below.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT(p.ProductID) -- Same results using JOIN
FROM Production.ProductProductPhoto AS p
JOIN Production.ProductReview AS r
	ON p.ProductID = r.ProductID;
````
***
