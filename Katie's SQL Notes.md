## üìå Filtering Techniques

### TOP Clause

**Limit results with TOP**
````sql
SELECT TOP 3 TaxRate
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC;
````
***

**Limit results with TOP PERCENT**

Specify the number of percentage of results to generate. For example, to generate the first 50% of the results, use `TOP 50 PERCENT`. 

````sql
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT TaxRate, Name
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC;
````
***
**Limit results with TOP X WITH TIES**

Results include multiple records of the same values from the last record. 

For example, we are interested to know the Top 5 students in the classroom. Since there are 2 students who have received the same 5th highest score in the classroom, hence there will be a total of 6 rows of records in the results table - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.

````sql
SELECT TOP 5 WITH TIES student_name, score
FROM classroom
ORDER BY score;
````
