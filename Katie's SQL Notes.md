## üìå Data Types

## üìå Basics

***

## üìå Filtering Techniques

### Using WHERE

***

### Limit Results with TOP

**1. Limit results with TOP**
````sql
SELECT TOP 3 TaxRate
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC;
````
***

**2. Limit results with TOP PERCENT**

Specify the number of percentage of results to generate. For example, to generate the first 50% of the results, use `TOP 50 PERCENT`. 

````sql
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT TaxRate, Name
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate
ORDER BY TaxRate DESC;
````
***

**3. Limit results with TOP X WITH TIES**

Results include multiple records of the same values from the last record. 

For example, we are interested to know the Top 5 students in the classroom. Since there are 2 students who have received the same 5th highest score in the classroom, hence there will be a total of 6 rows of records in the results table - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.

````sql
SELECT TOP 5 WITH TIES student_name, score
FROM classroom
ORDER BY score;
````

***

### Remove duplicates with DISTINCT

To remove duplicates and retrieve unique values only.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT City, StateProvinceID
FROM Person.Address
ORDER BY City;
````

***

### Comparison operators

| Comparison Operator | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| =                   | Equal to    |
| !=                  | Not equal to    |
| <>                   | Not equal to   |
| >                   | Greater than    |
| >=                   | Greater than or equal to    |
| <                   | Less than    |
| <=                   | Less than or equal to    |



***

**NULL Values**

Take note that we cannot use `!=` or `<>` on NULL values.

````sql
SELECT WorkOrderID, ScrappedQty, ScrapReasonID
FROM Production.WorkOrder
WHERE ScrapReasonID IS NOT NULL;
````
***

**ISNULL**

For example, replace NULL values with '99'.
````sql
SELECT WorkOrderID, ScrappedQty, ISNULL(ScrapReasonID, 99) AS ScrapReason
FROM Production.WorkOrder;
````

***

**Match texts using LIKE and Wildcards**

````sql
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%' -- Finds any values that starts with "a"
WHERE first_name LIKE '%a' -- Finds any values that ends with "a"
WHERE first_name LIKE '%ae%' -- Finds any values that have "ae" in the middle
WHERE first_name LIKE '_b%' -- Finds any values with "b" in the second position
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a_%_%' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%o' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a___' -- Finds any value that starts with "a" and has 3 characters
WHERE first_name LIKE '[abc]%' -- Finds any values with "a", "b" or "c"
WHERE first_name LIKE '[a-f]%' -- Finds any values with "a" to "f"
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a[l-n]' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and has "l", "m" or "n"
WHERE first_name LIKE 'a[c-e]__' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and has "c", "d" or "e" in the middle and ends with 2 characters
````

***

## üìå JOINS

### Inner Joins

````sql
SELECT p.BusinessEntityID, p.FirstName, p.LastName, pp.PhoneNumber
FROM Person.Person AS p
JOIN Person.PersonPhone AS pp
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = pp.BusinessEntityID;
````  

### Left Joins

````sql
SELECT p.BusinessEntityID, p.PersonType, p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle
FROM Person.Person AS p
LEFT JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID;
````


### Right Joins

````sql
SELECT p.BusinessEntityID, p.PersonType, p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle
FROM Person.Person AS p
RIGHT JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e
	ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID;
````

### Cross Joins

For example, table_1 has 10 rows and table_2 has 5 rows. A `CROSS JOIN` would result in 10 rows x 5 rows = 50 rows table.

````sql
SELECT d.Name AS DepartmentName, a.Name AS AddressName
FROM HumanResources.Department AS d
CROSS JOIN Person.AddressType AS a;
````

***

## üìå Grouping records

### GROUP BY and COUNT

Every column in `GROUP BY` clause needs to be in `SELECT` clause.

````sql
SELECT City, StateProvinceID, COUNT(*) AS AddressCount
FROM Person.Address
GROUP BY City, StateProvinceID
ORDER BY AddressCount DESC;
````

### GROUP BY and HAVING

`HAVING` must be used in conjuction with `GROUP BY`.

````sql
SELECT City, StateProvinceID, COUNT(*) AS AddressCount
FROM Person.Address
GROUP BY City, StateProvinceID
HAVING City = 'New York'
````
